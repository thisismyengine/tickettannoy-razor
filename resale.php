    <h1>Resale</h1>
    <p><strong>Easy, fair and secure: Introducing Ticket Tannoy’s Resale feature</strong><br>
    Safely sell unwanted tickets to new buyers and receive a full refund of the amount you paid</p>
    <p>We are Ticket Tannoy – Getting you into events you love</p>
</article>

    <h2>Sellers</h2>
    <p>If Resale is available for the event you’re attending, you’ll be able to offer your ticket to other buyers from within your Ticket Tannoy account. If another buyer is found, you’ll receive credit on your Ticket Tannoy account to the value of the full amount that you paid for the ticket. You can then decide whether you want to withdraw this credit into your bank account, or spend it on another ticket. There are no restrictions on where you can spend your credit.</p>
    <p>When you offer a ticket for resale, your original ticket is returned to us and the barcode is destroyed. A brand-new ticket with a new barcode is issued in its place to the new buyer, who pays no more than the current selling price.</p>
    <h4>Benefits:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>No risk of being ripped off – you’ll definitely receive your refund if a buyer is found</li>
        <li>You’re free to change your mind and retrieve your tickets if they haven’t been re-sold</li>
        <li>It’s free to resell your tickets</li>
    </ul>
